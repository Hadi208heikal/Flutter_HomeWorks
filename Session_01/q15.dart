// What does it mean for Dart to be a statically-typed language, and 
//how does it impact the way variables are used?


// Dart is statically typed, meaning variable types are determined at compile time.
/// This prevents assigning wrong types to variables, 
/// catches errors early, improves performance, 
/// it follows type safety

 

/// It means variables must keep a consistent type , 
/// so once a variable’s type is set you can’t assign a different type to it.

// Explain what happens if you try to use a variable before it is declared in Dart.

void main(List<String> args) {
  // let's try it
  // print(x);
}

// Undefined name 'x'.
// Try correcting the name to one that is defined, or defining the name.


// --> it's a compilation error : The variables must be declared before we can use it
